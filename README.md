# 🕵️‍♀️ Text Hiding in Images using Steganography (Cybersecurity Internship Project)

This project demonstrates a basic but powerful steganography technique: **hiding secret text inside images** using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** method.  
It's developed as part of my **Cybersecurity Internship** to explore data hiding and privacy techniques.

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
stegano/
│
├── hide_data.py # Function to hide secret message inside an image
├── reveal_data.py # Function to reveal hidden message from an image
├── main.py # One-click script to hide & reveal the message
├── requirements.txt # Required libraries (mainly pillow)
└── flower.png # Your input image (any .png or .jpg)






## 🖼️ Supported Image Formats
✅ .png (Recommended)

⚠️ .jpg works, but may reduce accuracy due to compression

## 📦 Installation
Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Only one package is needed:
Pillow (for image processing)

## 🎓 Internship Takeaways
Implemented real steganography from scratch using Python

Learned about binary encoding, pixel manipulation & image formats

Practiced clean coding, modular design, and project documentation

## 🛡️ Disclaimer
This is a basic implementation meant for educational purposes during a cybersecurity internship.
It does not provide strong cryptographic security.
